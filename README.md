The goal of this project was to examine batting trends in the NCAA softball data from the 2023 season to identify what factors most strongly contributed to the success of the top individual players and teams. I determined which metrics are the most closely related to generating runs and which ones are the strongest predictors of player performance. My model identified that walks, stolen bases, runs created, batting average, and OBP are the most critical variables in predicting the number of runs scored. Then, I created an XGBoost model that predicts the number of runs that each team would score, and applied the model to individual players to determine their offensive value to the team. Finally, I applied these metrics to analyze the Notre Dame offense to identify their weaknesses and to make actionable suggestions for areas of improvement to work on in the offseason. One limitation to this project is that NCAA softball only has basic statistics publicly available, so I created calculated fields for my batting dataset so that I would be able to work with more advanced metrics in my analysis.
